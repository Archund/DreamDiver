# Dream Diver

Complete the cats dreams to avoid waking it up


- The objective of this game is to challenge the player by presenting them with quick 'dreams' which they have to complete. These games are presented with a simple help text, and the player has to figure out what to do. This forces the player to learn the patterns of the game, and the challenge is kept by randomizing these games. The aim is to have the players lose themselves in focus.
